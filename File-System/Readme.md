# File System Utilities

This is a simple project of javascipt with a flavour of node in it. 
Since node gives the access of file system thus I have created a project in which I have designed some of the utilites commands that helps to work fastly and efficiently.

## Utilities commands are :

> **Tree** : Organize the file and folder into a tree structure

>  **Organize** : Organize different file into its own folder based on the file extension

> **Help** : will show all the command prepared for the execution
